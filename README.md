# AI Research Assistant with LangChain & Anthropic Claude

This project is an AI-powered research assistant built from scratch using LangChain, Anthropic Claude, and tool-based agents. It allows you to enter any research topic, and the agent will:

✅ Search the web for relevant information

✅ Pull data from Wikipedia

✅ Summarize the findings into a structured format

✅ Save the research results for later use

The system uses tool calling agents and a Pydantic-based output parser to ensure responses follow a structured schema.
